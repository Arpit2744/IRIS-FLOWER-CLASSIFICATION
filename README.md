🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project
This project focuses on classifying iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It demonstrates a simple but powerful machine learning workflow using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Load and explore the Iris dataset
✅ Visualize the data (pairplots, histograms, class distribution)
✅ Encode categorical targets
✅ Split data into training and testing sets
✅ Train Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models
✅ Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
✅ Visualize the Decision Tree and its feature importances
✅ Summarize insights

🛠️ Tools Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
SeabOrn
scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, train_test_split, etc.)

📊 Results
Logistic Regression achieved approximately 90% accuracy on the test set

Decision Tree achieved approximately 97% accuracy on the test set

Petal length and petal width were the most important features for classification

🌟 Conclusion
✅ The Decision Tree model performed best on this balanced and clean dataset
✅ Petal measurements are highly discriminative features
✅ Future improvements could explore Random Forests or SVM for additional robustness

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone <your_repo_link>
Make sure iris.csv and the notebook are in the same folder

Open the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode

Run all cells from top to bottom
